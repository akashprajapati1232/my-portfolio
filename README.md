# my-portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks). It showcases my profile, skills, projects, and achievements as a BCA student. This site reflects my learning and creativity as a student developer. Iâ€™ll keep improving it over time.  Feel free to explore or suggest improvements!
