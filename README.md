## ✨ Animation Details

### Jellyfish Animation

The jellyfish animation in the hero section is created using LottieFiles. It reacts to mouse movement, creating an interactive experience. The animation is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. If the LottieFiles script fails to load, a fallback CSS animation is provided.

### Particle Background

The background particles are created using Particles.js. They respond to mouse movement and clicks, adding an interactive layer to the website. The particle density and behavior are optimized for different devices to ensure smooth performance.

### Card Tilt Effect

The cards throughout the website use VanillaTilt.js to create a 3D tilt effect when hovered. This adds depth and interactivity to the UI. The tilt effect is applied to project cards, skill cards, and achievement cards.

### Typing Animation

The hero section features a typing animation that cycles through different roles (Web Developer, Software Developer, etc.). This is implemented using a custom JavaScript function that simulates typing and deleting text.

The certificate gallery provides an interactive way to view and download certificates:
- Grid layout for easy browsing of all certificates
- Lightbox view for detailed examination
- Navigation controls (previous/next) for browsing through certificates
- Download functionality with success notification
- Keyboard navigation support (arrow keys, Escape)
- Responsive design for all devices
